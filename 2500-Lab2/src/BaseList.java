
// This class is just a starting point for the four lists that will be used in this project.
// Because the only thing that will differentiate them is the WAY we do the additions to the
// list, we can put all of the code that's common to ALL of them here, and use inheritance 
// to build the four specific lists.  We declare this one as being abstract simply to keep 
// from accidentally instantiating it -- it doesn't HAVE its add method.
//
// By forcing this layer of inheritance into the process, every list's class just consists 
// of a one-line constructor (to call this one) which is the super() we use, and its add() method.
